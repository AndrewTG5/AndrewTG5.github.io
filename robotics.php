				<p>What does the robot have to do?</p>
				<p>Each year there is a different challenge. This year’s challenge is called Roundup and requires your
					robot
					to pick up plastic rings and deposit them on goalposts. The idea is to “own” goalposts by having
					more of
					your rings on them than the
					opposition, to own as many goalposts as possible, and score as many rings in total as possible. Part
					of
					the strategy is scoring the opposition’s rings, and if possible placing them out of reach. All of
					this
					happens in a series of fast paced
					matches lasting only two minutes.</p>
				<p>All of this involves not only building a robot from metal, gears and motors, but also programming it
					with
					control instructions and learning to drive it accurately by remote control.</p>
