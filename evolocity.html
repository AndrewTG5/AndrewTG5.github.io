            School teams build a vehicle (either a bike or with 3+ wheels)
            powered by a standard 350W electric motor, controller and two 12V
            gel cells. Innovation is encouraged as students strive to make their
            vehicle the fastest with the least drag, and able to cope with the
            demands of a tight street circuit. The Innovation categories
            encourage teams to build in object detection and mitigation features
            along with the measurement and display of key performance metrics.

            Our regional finals are a fun day of competition where teams parade
            their designs and then test them in competition against their peers
            from other schools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Good performances are rewarded with an excellent array of prizes
            from our generous sponsors.
