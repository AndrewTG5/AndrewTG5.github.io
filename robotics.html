            Robotics is a competitive robotics programme where students are
            challenged to design and build robots to achieve specific tasks. It
            is all about involvement, learning, teamwork and problem solving.

          <p>What does the robot have to do?</p>
          <p>
            Each year there is a different challenge. This year’s challenge is
            called Roundup and requires your robot to pick up plastic rings and
            deposit them on goalposts. The idea is to “own” goalposts by having
            more of your rings on them than the opposition, to own as many
            goalposts as possible, and score as many rings in total as possible.
            Part of the strategy is scoring the opposition’s rings, and if
            possible placing them out of reach. All of this happens in a series
            of fast paced matches lasting only two minutes.
          </p>

            All of this involves not only building a robot from metal, gears and
            motors, but also programming it with control instructions and
            learning to drive it accurately by remote control.
